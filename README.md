# Bull-Cows
Word Game developed using Ionic. As of now it is a browser app.
If you have ionic installed clone the project and give ionic serve in the command prompt


About the Game
The user has to find the hard coded four letter value by guessing a four letter word
If the position of the guessed letter and the hard coded letter are same, bull count will increase
and if the position does not match cow count will increase
So ultimately when 4 bulls are shown the game is over.
